## About This Project
([Back to top ^](#rps-v2))

This project was originally assigned as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s Foundations curriculum (located [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)).

However, after completing that project (and not really liking the final result too much), I decided to come back to the idea of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and try again with something more fun and aesthetically pleasing. So I came up with the idea of "Rogue, Paladin, Sorceress" (get it? Same initials?), added some story elements, and voila! A much better result, if I do say so myself. (If you'd like to check out my *first* version, [click here](https://risclover.github.io/RPS-v1)!)

I also decided to take the opportunity to practice jQuery, and wrote this version's code in mostly jQuery.

## How to Play
([Back to top ^](#rps-v2))

1. When you first open the page, you're met with some instructions. You should read these, and then click on the Start Game button, located underneath the instructions.
2. After the game begins, you can see your score, the Computer's score, and three buttons - one for choosing Rogue, one for choosing Paladin, and one for choosing Sorceress. Click one to make your selection.
    * In case you didn't know, a "rogue" in RPG-style games is a thief/knives/bow kind of character.
    * A "paladin" is basically a holy knight (who, in most games, can usually heal, but in this case, our Paladin is just a warrior).
3. In this game, Rogue beats Sorceress, Sorceress beats Paladin, and Paladin beats Rogue. So depending on what you've chosen and what the Computer has chosen, you will either win, lose, or tie the round.
4. The game goes until either the Player or the Computer reaches 5 points.
5. Once the game is over, you can click the "Start Over" button to play again!
